# LitterMapper
[LitterMapper](https://na5im.github.io/) is a tool for tracking and visualizing litter in PG County, MD. It uses the [LitterTRAK API](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Environment/LitterTRAK/9tsa-iner) to access data on the location of data and uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to display this information on the map. LitterMapper can be accessed through any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) on any modern device (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux).

## What our project displays and solves
Our project, LitterMapper, is designed to help visualize data on trash and debris collection in PG County. The data is collected by PG County, but it is not currently presented in a visual format. By using LitterMapper, we can see patterns in the collection of trash and debris that can help us keep our cities and county cleaner.

LitterMapper uses Leaflet to create an interactive map with markers that show where trash and debris have been collected in PG County. The markers are placed using districts, as this is how PG County's LitterTRAK classifies latitude and longitude coordinates.

With LitterMapper, users can easily view the locations of litter and debris pick-ups in the county, and can even filter the data by type of litter. This can help to identify areas that may need more attention when it comes to litter pick-up, and can help to improve overall cleanliness in PG County.
